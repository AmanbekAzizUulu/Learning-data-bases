1. **Local Variable**: This term is used to describe a variable that is declared and used within a specific block of code, such as a stored procedure, function, or trigger. Its scope is limited to that block of code.

   - **Synonyms**:
     - Block-level variable
     - Procedure-level variable
     - Function-local variable

2. **Session Variable**: This term is used to describe a user-defined variable in SQL that is specific to a database session. It is available throughout the session until the session ends or the variable is explicitly reset.

   - **Synonyms**:
     - Session-scoped variable
     - User-defined variable (when referring to session-specific variables)
     - Session-specific variable

These terms highlight the scope and context in which the variables are used within SQL programming.

In SQL, user-defined variables and local variables are both used to store temporary data during the execution of SQL scripts or stored procedures. They have different scopes and ways of declaration and initialization.

### 1. **User-Defined Variables**

#### **Scope**:
- User-defined variables are session-specific, meaning they are accessible throughout the current database session until the session ends.

#### **Declaration and Initialization**:
- User-defined variables do not need to be explicitly declared. They are created and initialized when first used.

#### **Syntax**:
- **Declaration and Initialization**: A user-defined variable is prefixed with `@`.
  ```sql
  SET @variable_name = value;  -- Sets the value of the variable
  ```
- **Example**:
  ```sql
  SET @total_sales = 100.50;   -- Initialize and assign value to the variable
  SELECT @total_sales;         -- Retrieve the value of the variable
  ```

- **Automatic Initialization**:
  You can also assign a value to a user-defined variable directly within a query:
  ```sql
  SELECT @total_sales := SUM(sales_amount) FROM sales;
  ```
  This sets `@total_sales` to the sum of `sales_amount` from the `sales` table.

### 2. **Local Variables**

#### **Scope**:
- Local variables are only accessible within the block of code (such as a stored procedure, function, or trigger) where they are declared.

#### **Declaration and Initialization**:
- Local variables must be explicitly declared before they can be used.

#### **Syntax**:
- **Declaration**: Use the `DECLARE` statement to declare a local variable.
  ```sql
  DECLARE variable_name datatype [DEFAULT value];
  ```
  - `variable_name`: Name of the variable.
  - `datatype`: Data type of the variable (e.g., `INT`, `DECIMAL`, `VARCHAR`).
  - `DEFAULT value`: Optional, assigns an initial value to the variable.

- **Initialization**:
  - You can initialize a local variable at the time of declaration using the `DEFAULT` keyword or by setting its value using the `SET` statement after declaring it.
  ```sql
  DECLARE total_sales DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0.00;  -- Declaration with initialization
  SET total_sales = 100.50;                        -- Assign value to the variable
  ```

- **Example**:
  ```sql
  DELIMITER $$

  CREATE PROCEDURE calculate_total_sales()
  BEGIN
      DECLARE total_sales DECIMAL(10,2);  -- Declare a local variable
      SET total_sales = 0.00;             -- Initialize the variable

      -- Calculate total sales
      SELECT SUM(sales_amount) 
      INTO total_sales
      FROM sales;

      -- Use the variable
      SELECT total_sales;
  END $$

  DELIMITER ;
  ```

  - **Explanation**:
    - `total_sales` is a local variable declared and initialized within the stored procedure.
    - The `SUM(sales_amount)` result is stored in `total_sales`, and then itâ€™s used within the procedure.

### **Summary**

- **User-Defined Variables**:
  - Created and initialized using the `SET` or `:=` operator.
  - Prefixed with `@`.
  - Session-scoped.
  
- **Local Variables**:
  - Declared using `DECLARE`.
  - Initialized using `DEFAULT` or `SET`.
  - Block-scoped (only within stored procedures, functions, triggers).
  
Understanding the scope and usage of these variables is crucial for writing efficient SQL code, especially in more complex queries and stored procedures.
