The `WITH CHECK OPTION` clause in SQL is used to ensure that any modifications (inserts or updates) to a view conform to the criteria defined by the view's `WHERE` clause. If you try to update or insert data that would not be visible through the view (i.e., it doesn't meet the `WHERE` condition of the view), the operation is rejected.

### Example

Suppose you have a view that shows only active employees:

```sql
CREATE VIEW ActiveEmployees AS
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE status = 'Active'
WITH CHECK OPTION;
```

In this case:

- If someone tries to update an employee's status to something other than 'Active' through this view, the update will be rejected.
- If someone tries to insert a new employee with a status other than 'Active', the insert will also be rejected.

The `WITH CHECK OPTION` ensures that the integrity of the view's data is maintained according to its definition.
