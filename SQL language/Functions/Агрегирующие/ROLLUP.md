The `ROLLUP` operator in SQL is used to generate subtotals and grand totals in the result set. It is an extension to the `GROUP BY` clause and is useful for creating summary reports. When you use `ROLLUP`, it creates additional rows that represent the subtotals for each grouping level and a grand total.

Here’s what `WITH ROLLUP` does in the context of the `GROUP BY` clause:

1. **Basic Grouping**: The query groups the data by the specified columns as usual.
2. **Subtotals**: For each level of grouping, `ROLLUP` adds a subtotal row. For example, if you group by columns A, B, and C, `ROLLUP` will create subtotal rows for each unique combination of A and B, and for each unique A.
3. **Grand Total**: At the end of the result set, `ROLLUP` adds a grand total row that sums up all the data.

In the given query:

```sql
group by rollup (c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name)
```

The `ROLLUP` will create the following:

1. **Group by `customer_id`, `first_name`, and `last_name`**: Regular grouping for each customer.
2. **Subtotal for each `customer_id`**: A subtotal row for each unique `customer_id` that aggregates data for all the customer's first and last names.
3. **Grand Total**: A single row at the end with the grand total of all sales.

Here’s an example to illustrate:

Suppose your data looks like this:

| customer_id | first_name | last_name | total_sales |
|-------------|------------|-----------|-------------|
| 1           | John       | Doe       | 200         |
| 1           | John       | Smith     | 150         |
| 2           | Jane       | Roe       | 300         |

With `ROLLUP`, the result might look like this:

| customer_id | first_name | last_name | total_sales |
|-------------|------------|-----------|-------------|
| 1           | John       | Doe       | 200         |
| 1           | John       | Smith     | 150         |
| 1           | NULL       | NULL      | 350         |  -- Subtotal for customer_id 1
| 2           | Jane       | Roe       | 300         |
| 2           | NULL       | NULL      | 300         |  -- Subtotal for customer_id 2
| NULL        | NULL       | NULL      | 650         |  -- Grand Total

The `NULL` values indicate the levels of aggregation. The row with all `NULL` values represents the grand total.
