In SQL, `ANY` and `SOME` are used for comparison operations with subqueries. They are interchangeable and can be used to compare a value to any value in a list or result set returned by a subquery. These keywords return `TRUE` if the comparison is true for at least one of the values in the list or result set.

### Basic Syntax and Usage

#### ANY

The `ANY` keyword is used to compare a value to any value in a subquery. It returns `TRUE` if the comparison holds true for at least one of the values.

```sql
SELECT 
	column_name(s)
FROM 
	table_name
WHERE 
	column_name comparison_operator ANY (subquery);
```

#### SOME

The `SOME` keyword has the same functionality as `ANY` and can be used interchangeably. The syntax is identical.

```sql
SELECT 
	column_name(s)
FROM 
	table_name
WHERE 
	column_name comparison_operator SOME (subquery);
```

### Example and Detailed Explanation

Consider a scenario where we have two tables: `products` and `orders`.

#### Table: `products`

| product_id | product_name | price |
|------------|---------------|-------|
| 1          | Product A     | 100   |
| 2          | Product B     | 200   |
| 3          | Product C     | 300   |

#### Table: `orders`

| order_id | product_id | quantity | order_date |
|----------|------------|----------|------------|
| 1        | 1          | 10       | 2024-07-01 |
| 2        | 2          | 5        | 2024-07-02 |
| 3        | 3          | 20       | 2024-07-03 |
| 4        | 1          | 15       | 2024-07-04 |

### Example Using ANY/SOME

Let's find products with a price greater than the price of any product that has been ordered in quantities of more than 10.

#### Using ANY

```sql
SELECT product_name, price
FROM products
WHERE price > ANY
    (
        SELECT price
        FROM products
        WHERE product_id IN
            (
                SELECT product_id
                FROM orders
                WHERE quantity > 10
            )
    );
```

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Subquery 1: Find `product_id`s with quantity > 10**

    ```sql
    SELECT 
	    product_id
    FROM 
	    orders
    WHERE 
	    quantity > 10
    ```

    - This subquery selects `product_id`s from the `orders` table where the quantity is greater than 10.

2. **Subquery 2: Find prices of these products**

    ```sql
    SELECT 
	    price
    FROM 
	    products
    WHERE 
	    product_id IN
        (
            SELECT 
	            product_id
            FROM 
	            orders
            WHERE 
	            quantity > 10
        )
    ```

    - This subquery selects the prices of products whose `product_id` is in the list of `product_id`s returned by Subquery 1.

3. **Main Query: Compare prices**

    ```sql
    SELECT 
	    product_name, price
    FROM 
	    products
    WHERE 
	    price > ANY
        (
            SELECT 
	            price
            FROM 
	            products
            WHERE 
	            product_id IN
                (
                    SELECT 
	                    product_id
                    FROM 
	                    orders
                    WHERE 
	                    quantity > 10
                )
        );
    ```

    - The main query selects `product_name` and `price` from the `products` table where the `price` is greater than any price returned by Subquery 2.
    - `price > ANY` means that the `price` of the product in the main query should be greater than at least one price from the subquery.

#### Results

Based on the example data, the query would return:

| product_name | price |
|--------------|-------|
| Product C    | 300   |

This is because `Product C` with a price of 300 is greater than any price of products ordered in quantities greater than 10 (which are Product A with price 100 and Product C with price 300, considering our example).

### Summary

- **`ANY` and `SOME`**: Both keywords can be used interchangeably to compare a value with any value in a set of values returned by a subquery.
- **Usage**: These keywords are typically used with comparison operators (`=`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`).
- **Functionality**: They return `TRUE` if the comparison holds true for at least one value in the set.

By using `ANY` or `SOME`, you can create flexible and powerful queries to compare data against a dynamic set of values.
