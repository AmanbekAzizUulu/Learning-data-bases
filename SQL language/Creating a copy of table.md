When using the `CREATE TABLE ... AS` statement in SQL, you’re creating a new table and populating it with data from an existing table or query. Here are some key features and considerations:

### Features

1. **Table Creation**: The statement creates a new table (`table_name`) based on the result of the `SELECT` query.

2. **Column Definition**: The new table’s columns are automatically defined based on the columns returned by the `SELECT` query. The column names and data types are inferred from the result set.

3. **Data Insertion**: The new table is populated with the data returned by the `SELECT` query. The data is copied from the source tables or queries into the new table.

4. **No Constraints or Indexes**: The new table does not inherit any constraints (like primary keys or foreign keys) or indexes from the source table. These must be added separately if needed.

5. **Data Types**: Data types for the new table’s columns are determined by the data types of the corresponding columns in the result set of the `SELECT` query.

### Considerations

1. **Column Names**: Column names in the new table are taken from the `SELECT` query. If the `SELECT` query includes expressions or column aliases, these names will be used in the new table.

2. **Performance**: Creating a table with the `CREATE TABLE ... AS` statement can be resource-intensive if the source query returns a large amount of data.

3. **Table Structure**: The new table’s structure is determined solely by the `SELECT` query. If you need specific data types, constraints, or indexes, you must add them after table creation.

4. **Temporary Tables**: This statement can be used to create temporary tables for intermediate processing. Temporary tables are session-specific and automatically dropped when the session ends.

5. **Permissions**: You need appropriate permissions to create tables in the database and to access the data being queried.

### Example

Here’s an example illustrating the use of `CREATE TABLE ... AS`:

```sql
-- Create a new table 'archived_orders' based on the data from 'orders'
create table archived_orders as
select
    order_id,
    customer_id,
    order_date,
    total_amount
from
    orders
where
    order_date < '2023-01-01';
```

In this example:
- A new table `archived_orders` is created.
- It contains columns `order_id`, `customer_id`, `order_date`, and `total_amount`, as specified in the `SELECT` query.
- The data is copied from the `orders` table where the `order_date` is before January 1, 2023.
