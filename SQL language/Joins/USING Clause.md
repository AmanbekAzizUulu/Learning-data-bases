The `USING` clause in SQL is used to simplify the `JOIN` operations when two tables have one or more columns with the same name that are being used as the basis for the join. It is a part of the `JOIN` syntax and can be used with different types of joins, such as `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, etc.

### Syntax
```sql
SELECT 
	columns
FROM 
	table1
JOIN 
	table2
	USING (column_name);
```

### Example
Let's say we have two tables: `employees` and `departments`. Both tables have a column named `department_id`.

#### Table: employees
| employee_id | first_name | last_name | department_id |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| 1           | John        | Doe       | 101           |
| 2           | Jane        | Smith     | 102           |

#### Table: departments
| department_id | department_name |
|---------------|-----------------|
| 101           | HR              |
| 102           | Engineering     |

To join these tables on the `department_id` column using the `USING` clause, you can write:
```sql
SELECT 
	employees.employee_id, 
	employees.first_name, 
	employees.last_name, 
	departments.department_name
FROM 
	employees
JOIN 
	departments
	USING (department_id);
```

### Explanation
1. **Simplifies the Join Condition**: The `USING` clause simplifies the join condition when the join is based on columns with the same name. You don't need to write the full condition `ON table1.column = table2.column`.
   
2. **Eliminates Redundancy**: When you use the `USING` clause, the result set will not include duplicate columns from the joined tables. Instead, it will include the column once.

### Considerations
- The columns used in the `USING` clause must have the same name in both tables.
- The `USING` clause can include multiple columns if necessary, like `USING (column1, column2)`.
- It is particularly useful when joining tables with several columns that have the same name.

### Additional Example with Multiple Columns
If you have another common column, say `location_id`, you can join on both `department_id` and `location_id`:
```sql
SELECT 
	employees.employee_id, 
	employees.first_name, 
	employees.last_name, 
	departments.department_name
FROM 
	employees
JOIN 
	departments
	USING (department_id, location_id);
```

This makes the SQL statement cleaner and avoids repetition.
