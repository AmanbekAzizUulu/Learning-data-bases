The domain integrity constraint in a database ensures that all values in a column fall within a defined domain or set of acceptable values. It guarantees that the data entered into a column adheres to the rules and restrictions specified for that column. This type of constraint maintains the accuracy and consistency of the data.

Here’s a breakdown of how domain integrity constraints work:

1. **Data Type Constraint**: Specifies the type of data that can be stored in a column (e.g., INTEGER, VARCHAR, DATE). For instance, a column meant for storing dates will only accept date values.

2. **Range Constraints**: Defines a valid range for numeric values. For example, an `age` column might be constrained to accept values between 0 and 120.

3. **Enumerated Values**: Limits the values in a column to a predefined set. For example, a `status` column might be constrained to accept only values like 'Active', 'Inactive', or 'Pending'.

4. **Length Constraints**: Specifies the maximum length of data for columns, particularly for string types. For instance, a `username` column might be constrained to a maximum of 30 characters.

5. **NOT NULL Constraints**: Ensures that a column cannot have null values. This guarantees that every record has a valid value for that column.

6. **Default Values**: Provides a default value for a column if no value is provided. For instance, a `created_at` column might default to the current date and time.

Here’s an example of how you might define domain constraints in SQL:

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    age INT CHECK (age >= 18 AND age <= 65),
    status ENUM('Active', 'Inactive', 'Pending') NOT NULL,
    hire_date DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE
);
```

In this example:
- `name` must have a value (`NOT NULL` constraint).
- `age` must be between 18 and 65 (`CHECK` constraint).
- `status` can only be 'Active', 'Inactive', or 'Pending' (`ENUM` constraint).
- `hire_date` defaults to the current date if no value is provided (`DEFAULT` constraint).
